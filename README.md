## FotoFix

A friend introduced me to FabricJS and I wanted to use it in a project. I decided to create a very basic web app for adding filters to images. You can view FotoFix here: https://darraghobrien.com/projects/fotofix

### Running Locally

Sorter is a react app, to run locally you will need to have node installed. Clone the project to your machine, run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.
